# Learn 0.1
## Git and GitHub

You guys might think why this is named as **Learn 0.1**, the reason we named like that is these are the prerequisites that you should know before starting actial Concepts.
Let's start with the concepts.

### What is Version Control?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Some benifits of Version Control are:
- A complete long-term change history of every file. We can have a track of every single commit in our Project.
- Branching and merging. You'll get to know about this later
- Traceability

### What is Git?
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).


### How to install Git?
Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.

**Installing on Linux: ** '''$ sudo dnf install git-all'''
