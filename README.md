# Learn 0.1
## Git and GitHub

You guys might think why this is named as **Learn 0.1**, the reason we named like that is these are the prerequisites that you should know before starting actial Concepts.
Let's start with the concepts.

### What is Version Control?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Some benifits of Version Control are:
- A complete long-term change history of every file. We can have a track of every single commit in our Project.
- Branching and merging. You'll get to know about this later
- Traceability

### What is Git?
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).


### How to install Git?
Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.

**Installing on Windows:**

As many of you use Windows OS check out this step by step tutorial https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows

**Installing on Linux:** 
```$ sudo dnf install git-all```

**Debian-based distribution:** 
```$ sudo apt install git-all```

**Installing on macOS:**
There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

```$ git --version```

If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
After all, in the world of programming, naming conventions aren’t always intuitive. That’s why it’s worth recognizing the connections and the differences in the similarly named Git and GitHub. Both Git and GitHub give programmers valuable version-control functionality so that they can build ongoing coding projects without being afraid of messing everything up. GitHub just takes things a little bit further than Git, offering more functionality and resources, as well as a place online to store and collaborate on projects. See the below image for a simple understanding on the difference.
